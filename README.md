# Advanced Security 1 - Assignment
## Assignment Instructions
- Write a Java program which will test if the given number is a prime number or not. In order to achieve this you have to implement the Miller-Rabin Algorithm as shown in the lectures
- Write a Java program to perform the Key Expansion of AES algorithm as shown in the lectures. You donâ€™t need to implement the whole AES algorithm

## How to run Key Expansion
- Execute compileAES.sh to compile the program
- Execute executeAES.sh to start the GUI
- Input a 16 byte key to be expanded
- Click "Start" to start the key expansion

## How to run Miller-Rabin
- Execute compileMillerRabin.sh to compile the program
- Execute executeMillerRabin.sh to start the GUI
- Input a number to test for primality
- Click "Test" to check if the number is probably prime using the Miller-Rabin Algorithm
